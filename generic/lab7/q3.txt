YOU ARE A SUPER CODER

I first tried using the regular decode function but I got random giberish I could not read. After using the coredump function I got the memory for the entire message and found that it was really interesting, "collumn 2" was random numbers between 1 and 9(maybe 10), and 4 was all above 200. 3 was all between 70 and 100, and 1 was all over the place. After trying the first collumn I found that it was also giberish, so I tried to code it such that it would only look at ones that corresponded to a character which gave me the sequence in line 1. I suspect there may be a math system where the ascii character is mutliplied by a factor in the 2nd collumn but I do not have the time to try before the due time. 

During the extra time provided I figured out the system of encryption used, using the 2nd row of ints(using the core dump and then organizing it to make it look nice) was subtracted by the third to get the letter. that gave me: YOU ARE A SUPER CODER. In the code I just added two lines, I assinged the 2nd byte to a varaible and subtracted that variable from the 3rd byte.
